*Git Workflows*

1. Setup a basic workflow to test changeset. When i raise a PR, a job should run to test (echo test)

  name: PR_Test

  # Controls when the workflow will run
  on:
    # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch

    pull_request:
      branches: [ "main" ]


  # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
  jobs:
    print_test:
      runs-on: ubuntu_latest
      steps: 
        - run: echo "Insert tests here"
